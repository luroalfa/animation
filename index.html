      <!-- First objective section -->
      <section>
        <p>
          As part of the learning process about animations, these are some of my
          exercises applied in this module.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="subTitle animate__animated animate__backInLeft">
          1) Objective:
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The first exercise is about to create an animation with at least three
          principles of animation. In this case, I made an animation at After
          Effects about how to bounce the ball. In this image gif is a simple
          exercise, we can see the following principles of animation the first
          principle is squash and stretch.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This is the principle that gives flexibility to objects, we can see as
          the ball starts to fall and picks up speed, the ball will stretch out
          just before impact as the ball impacts the floor, it squashes before
          stretching again as it takes off. When it is squashed or stretched,
          the width and depth need to correspond accordingly.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The second principle is the ease in and ease out, this principle is
          about having a time for acceleration and deceleration of an object.
          Without ease in and ease out, movements become very unnatural and
          robotic. That's why the ball has a smooth exit up and a smooth entry
          down in the movements up of the ball.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          And last but not least, we have the third principle applied, which is
          about the secondary action. Every animation has to have a secondary
          action to support or emphasize the main action to breathe more life
          into the animation and create a more convincing performance. It's
          important to remember that the secondary action should typically be
          something subtle that doesn't detract from the main action happening.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In my exercise, you can find the secondary action as the shadow where
          get large and shrinks, also its color is more intense when the ball
          hits the floor and it's less intense when it moves away from the
          floor.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="subTitle">Challenge:</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          My challenge in this project was to apply the ease in and ease out at
          the ball. Because I didn't know how to do it, and finally I learned to
          apply it through some tutorial videos.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="subTitle">Technologies:</h3>
        <br />
        <p>For this project, I used After Effects to make it.</p>
        <article class="imageContainer">
          <img
            src="./img/animationBall.gif"
            alt="bounce the ball"
            class="img-ball"
          />
        </article>

      <!-- Second objective section -->
      <section>
        <h3 class="subTitle animate__animated animate__backInLeft">
          2) Objective:
        </h3>
        <p>
          In this objective is the construction of an animation using the theme assigned by the teacher. In my case the topic is about the sale of shoes from a store. Points to evaluate:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>1) The result must be attractive according to the target audience.</li>
          <li>2) The animation must incorporate a CTA.</li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <h3 class="subTitle">Challenge:</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The hardest thing was working with the time of each object.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3 class="subTitle">Technologies:</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          For this project, I used the following technologies to make the website: Html, CSS, and Illustrator to create the design of the banner.
        </p>
        <br />
      </section>
      <!-- Third objective section -->
      <section>
        <h3 class="subTitle animate__animated animate__backInLeft">
          3) Objective:
        </h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          In this case, the objective is to create a web banner with Html and
          CSS.The principle idea is not to use gif images but that the
          animations are made with CSS. My topic for this project is pets for
          adoption.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Note important: When creating banners for advertising, you should know
          which sizes to use. This is important because banner size is a
          important factor in how an ad will perform.
        </p>
        <p>That is why I share the following list of sizes for banners.</p>

        <!-- Web Banner in css -->
        <section class="gridBanner">
          <article class="content">
            <p>The popular sizes are:</p>
            <ul class="listBanners">
              <li>160x600 pixel wide skyscraper.</li>
              <li>300x250 pixel medium rectangle.</li>
              <li>320x50 pixel mobile leaderboard.</li>
              <li>728x90 pixel leaderboard banner.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>And then, these others banners as standard ad sizes:</p>
            <ul class="listBanners">
              <li>120x600 pixel vertical banner.</li>
              <li>125x125 pixel button.</li>
              <li>180x150 pixel small rectangle.</li>
              <li>234x60 pixel half banner.</li>
              <li>250x250 pixel small square.</li>
              <li>300x600 pixel half-page ad.</li>
              <li>300x1050 pixel portrait.</li>
              <li>336x280 pixel large rectangle.</li>
              <li>468x60 pixel banner.</li>
              <li>970x90 pixel large leaderboard.</li>
              <li>970x250 pixel billboard.</li>
